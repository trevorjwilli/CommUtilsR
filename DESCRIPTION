Description: This package contains several functions that are useful for the manipulation
    of community datasets, including the conversion of occurrence records in the form
    of csv's to presence/absence matrices or abundance matrices, and the merging of 
    data from separate csvs (i.e. locality information csv and environmental data csv).
    Future development will also allow researchers to clip presence/absence matrices from
    spatial polygons data.
